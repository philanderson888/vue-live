## Displaying A Pack Of Cards

Please visit [https://philanderson.uk](https://philanderson.uk) and click on 'VueJS' to visit my blog about the work I have done to create two pages showing 1) A pack of playing cards in order 2) The ability to shuffle and unshuffle such a pack.

Or click on [https://epic-hamilton-f35937.netlify.com](https://epic-hamilton-f35937.netlify.com/shufflecards) and find the two pages for displaying cards and displaying a shuffled pack of cards.
